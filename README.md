Notes:

- TC of a recursive solution is generally:
    - O(n) if the fn itself called once in one execution of fn,
    - O(p^n) if the fn itself called p times in one execution of fn (e.g. 2 times in binary tress)
- SC of a recursive solution is generally O(n) as the max depth of call stack will take up 'n' fn calls/ items
